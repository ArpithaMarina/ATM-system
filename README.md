# ATM-system
New feature added is “Apply Loan” facility in the ATM itself. 
The user can see an apply loan option on ATM screen and this feature of applying loan in an ATM can be the best because applying and approval of loan in the bank takes a lot of time and procedures. Here the user can only apply for the loan, ATM doesn’t provide loan money. Sanctioning of loan (approval) will be done by the bank later.
After applying the loan, a receipt will be generated which has application number, applied date of loan, loan amount, loan status, monthly and total payment. The customer can apply loan for max 30 lakhs.
